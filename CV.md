## Other 
* I'm co-organizing a __summer school in mathematics and astronomy__ for ~17 years-old students since 4 years. The camp is called [Astromaths](https://www.fondation-blaise-pascal.org/nos-actions/les-projets-de-la-fondation/le-camp-astromaths/) and is organized in Ardèche, France. The high school students are supervised by a team of researchers, professors, teachers, students and high-skilled enthusiasts in astronomy. They practice out-from-school mathematical activities, sports and astronomical observations with professional material. 

    The camp is supported by the _Fondation Blaise Pascal_ and the _École Normale Supérieure de Lyon_.
